	<help>OTU differential abundance testing is commonly used to identify OTUs that
differ between two mapping file sample categories (i.e. Palm and Tongue body
sites).  We would recommend having at least 5 samples in each category.  These 
methods can be used in comparison to group_significance.py on a rarefied matrix, 
and we would always recommend comparing the results of these approaches to the
rarefied/group_significance.py approaches.  We would also recommend treating the
differentially abundant OTUs identified by these (metagenomeSeq zero-inflated Gaussian,
or ZIG, and DESeq2 negative binomial Wald test) techniques with caution, as they assume a
distribution and are therefore parametric tests.  Parametric tests can do poorly if
the assumptions about the data are not met.  These tests are also newer techniques
that are less well tested compared to rarefying with a group_significance.py test.  

The input is a raw (not normalized, not rarefied) matrix having uneven column sums.
With these techniques, we would still recommend removing low depth samples (e.g. below
1000 sequences per sample), and low abundance/rare OTUs from the data set.  The DESeq2 method
should NOT be used if the fit line on the dispersion plot (one of the diagnostic plots
output by the -d, or --DESeq2_diagnostic_plots option) does not look smooth, there are big
gaps in the point spacings, and the fitted line does not look appropriate for the data.

DESeq2 is stronger at very small/smaller data sets, but the run-time beyond 100 
total samples becomes very long.  MetagenomeSeq's fitZIG is a better algorithm for larger
library sizes and over 50 samples per category (e.g. 50 Palm samples), the more the better. 
In simulation, these techniques have higher sensitivity, but sometimes higher false positive
rate compared to the non-parametric tests (e.g. Wilcoxon rank sum) in group_significance.py, 
especially with very uneven library sizes (starting at 2-3 fold difference).  In practice 
and with real data, we do not observe much of a difference between these results and 
the tests in group_significance.py.

why rarefying microbiome data is inadmissible.' PLoS Comp. Bio. 2014.  For more on 
metagenomeSeq and fitZIG, please read Paulson, JN, et al. 'Differential abundance analysis
for microbial marker-gene surveys.'  Nature Methods 2013.  For DESeq2/DESeq please read
Love, MI et al. 'Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-Seq data 
with DESeq2,' Genome Biology 2014.  Anders S, Huber W. 'Differential expression analysis 
for sequence count data.' Genome Biology 2010.  Additionally, you can also read the
vignettes for each of the techniques on the Bioconductor/R websites.  Also, if you use
these methods, please CITE the proper sources above (metagenomeSeq and DESeq2) as well as QIIME.
The resulting output OTU txt file contains a list of all the OTUs in the input matrix, along with their associated statistics and FDR p-values.</help>
